<p>This document specifies a processing model and syntax for general
purpose inclusion.  Inclusion is accomplished by merging a number
of XML information sets into a single composite infoset. Specification
of the XML documents (infosets) to be merged and control over the
merging process is expressed in XML-friendly syntax (elements, attributes,
URI references).</p>

<div1 id="intro">
<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Many programming languages provide an inclusion mechanism to
facilitate modularity.  Markup languages also often have need of
such a mechanism.  This specification introduces a generic mechanism
for merging XML documents (as represented by their information sets)
for use by applications that need such a facility.  The syntax
leverages existing XML constructs - elements, attributes, and URI
references.</p>
<div2 id="rel-xlink">
<head>Relationship to XLink</head>
<p>XInclude differs from the linking features described in the
<bibref ref="XLink"/>, specifically links with the
attribute value <code>show="embed"</code>.  Such links provide
a media-type independent syntax for indicating that a resource
is to be embedded graphically within the display of the document.
XLink does not specify a specific processing model, but simply
facilitates the detection of links and recognition of associated
metadata by a higher level application.</p>
<p>XInclude, on the other hand, specifies a media-type specific
(XML into XML) transformation.  It defines a specific processing
model for merging information sets.  XInclude processing occurs
at a low level, often by a generic XInclude processor which makes
the resulting information set available to higher level
applications.</p>
<p>Simple information item inclusion as described in this specification
differs from transclusion, which preserves contextual
information such as style.</p>
</div2>
<div2 id="rel-extent">
<head>Relationship to XML External Entities</head>
<p>There are a number of differences between XInclude and
<bibref ref="XML"/> or <bibref ref="XML11"/> external entities
which make them complementary technologies.</p>
<p>Processing of external entities (as with the rest of DTDs)
occurs at parse time.  XInclude operates on information sets
and thus is orthogonal to parsing.</p>
<p>Declaration of external entities requires a DTD or internal subset.
This places a set of dependencies on inclusion, for instance, the syntax
for the DOCTYPE declaration requires that the document element be named -
orthogonal to inclusion in many cases.  Validating parsers
must have a complete content model defined.  XInclude is orthogonal
to validation and the name of the document element.</p>
<p>External entities provide a level of indirection - the external
entity must be declared and named, and separately invoked.
XInclude uses direct references.  Applications which generate
XML output incrementally can benefit from not having to pre-declare
inclusions.</p>
<p>Failure to load an external entity is normally a fatal error.
XInclude allows the author to provide default content that will be
used if the remote resource cannot be loaded.</p>
<p>The syntax for an internal subset is cumbersome to many authors
of simple well-formed XML documents.  XInclude syntax is based on
familiar XML constructs.</p>
</div2>
<div2 id="rel-dtd">
<head>Relationship to DTDs</head>
<p>XInclude defines no relationship to DTD validation.  XInclude
describes an infoset-to-infoset transformation and not a change
in XML parsing behavior.  XInclude does not define a
mechanism for DTD validation of the resulting infoset.</p>
</div2>
<div2 id="rel-xsd">
<head>Relationship to XML Schemas</head>
<p>XInclude defines no relationship to the augmented infosets
produced by applying an XML schema.  Such an augmented infoset
can be supplied as the input infoset, or such augmentation might
be applied to the infoset resulting from the inclusion.</p>
</div2>
<div2 id="rel-inc">
<head>Relationship to Grammar-Specific Inclusions</head>
<p>Special-purpose inclusion mechanisms have been introduced
into specific XML grammars.  XInclude provides a generic mechanism
for recognizing and processing inclusions, and as such can offer
a simpler overall authoring experience, greater performance, and
less code redundancy.</p>

<div2 id="include_element">
<head>xi:include Element</head>
<p>The <code>xi:include</code> element has the following
attributes:</p>
<glist>
<gitem>
<label>href</label>
<def>
<p>A value which, after appropriate escaping (see <specref ref="IRIs"/>)
has been performed, results in a URI reference or an
<termref def="dt-IRI">IRI reference</termref>
specifying the location of the resource to
include.  The <att>href</att> attribute is optional; the
absence of this attribute is the same as specifying
<att>href=""</att>, that is, the reference is to the same
document.  If the <att>href</att> attribute is absent when
XML processing is specified, the <att>xpointer</att>
or <att>fragid</att> attribute
<termref def="dt-must">must</termref> be present.  Fragment
identifiers <termref def="dt-must">must not</termref> be used;
their appearance is a <termref def="dt-error">fatal error</termref>.
A value that results in a syntactically invalid URI or IRI
<termref def="dt-must">should</termref>
be reported as a <termref def="dt-error">fatal error</termref>, but
some implementations may find it impractical to distinguish this
case from a <termref def="dt-resource-error">resource error</termref>.</p>

<note>
<p>A URI ending in <code>#</code> is considered by <bibref ref="RFC2396"/>
to have an empty fragment identifier.  Such a URI would result in a
<termref def="dt-error">fatal error</termref> as described above.</p>
</note>

<note>
<p>A key feature of XInclude is that it allows a resource to
be cast to a user-specifed type for inclusion. The returned
media type is therefore essentially ignored for the purposes
of inclusion processing, and the syntax of the fragment
identifier of the returned media type will generally not
be applicable to the user-specified type.
Therefore, in XInclude, subresources of the included resource
are identified by a separate <code>xpointer</code> or <code>fragid</code> attribute
which is applied after the casting takes place.
</p>
</note>

</def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>parse</label>
<def>
<p>Indicates how to parse the included resource.
The parse attribute allows XInclude to give the author of
the including document priority over the server of the included
document in terms of how to process the included content.
With two exceptions,
the value of the <att>parse</att> attribute <termref def="dt-must">must</termref>
conform to the requirements of a <em>media type</em>,
see <bibref ref="RFC4288"/>. The exceptions are “<code>xml</code>”
which <termref def="dt-must">must</termref> be treated as
“<code>application/xml</code>” and “<code>text</code>”,
which <termref def="dt-must">must</termref> be treated as
“<code>text/plain</code>”.</p>

<p>Implementations <termref def="dt-must">must</termref> process
the value of the <att>parse</att> attribute with standard
media type rules: if the media type is recognized, process it as that media type;
if the suffix is recognized, process it in accordance with that suffix; and finally,
if the family is recognized, process it in accordance with that family.</p>

<note>
<p>In accordance with these rules, a media type of “<code>application/unknown+xml</code>”
will be treated as XML (i.e. <code>application/xml</code>),
whereas a media type of “<code>text/unknown</code>” will
be treated as text (i.e. <code>text/plain</code>).</p>
</note>

<p>A value of “<code>xml</code>”, “<code>application/xml</code>”,
or a value with the “<code>+xml</code>” suffix
indicates that the resource <termref def="dt-must">must</termref>
be parsed as XML and the infosets merged.  A value of
“<code>text</code>”, “<code>text/plain</code>”, or a value in the
“<code>text</code>” family
indicates
that the resource <termref def="dt-must">must</termref> be included
as the character information items.  This attribute is optional.
When omitted, the value of “<code>application/xml</code>” is implied.
Values that specify neither XML processing nor text processing are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Implementations <termref def="dt-must">must</termref> treat
values of the <att>parse</att> attribute that it
does not recognize
as a
<termref def="dt-recoverable-error">recoverable error</termref>
and handle the <code>xi:include</code> element as described in
<specref ref="fallback"/>.
</p>
<note>
<p>For interoperability between validating and non-validating
systems, whitespace <termref def="dt-must">should not</termref>
appear in the parse attribute.</p>
</note>
</def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>xpointer</label>
<def>
<p>When the <att>parse</att> attribute specifies XML
processing, the XPointer (see <bibref ref="XPCore"/>)
contained in the <att>xpointer</att> attribute is evaluated to identify
a portion of the resource to include.</p>
<p>See <specref ref="xpointer-and-fragid"/>
for more information.</p>
</def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>fragid</label>
<def>
<p>The <att>fragid</att> attribute is a generalization of the <att>xpointer</att>
attribute. A <att>fragid</att> may be present regardless of the value of
the <att>parse</att> attribute.
The interpretation of the value of the attribute depends on
the value of <att>parse</att>. For XML processing, the value
is interpreted as an XPointer (see <bibref ref="XPCore"/>); for
text processing,
it is interpreted as a <bibref ref="RFC5147"/> fragment identifier. For other values
of <att>parse</att>, implementations
<termref def="dt-must">should</termref> process fragment identifiers per the
relevant media type
(i.e., media types registered per <bibref ref="RFC4288"/>),
but the interpretation
is not defined by this specification.</p>

<head>Using XInclude with Content Negotiation</head>
<p>The use of a mechanism like HTTP <bibref ref="RFC2616"/> content

into the use of XInclude. Developers who use XInclude in situations
where content negotiation is likely or possible should be aware of
the possibility that they will be including content that may differ
structurally from the content they expected, even if that content
is XML.  For example, a single URI or IRI may variously return a raw XML
representation of the resource, an XSL-FO <bibref ref="XSL-FO"/>
representation, or an XHTML <bibref ref="XHTML"/> representation,
as well as versions in different character encodings or languages.</p>

<p>Authors whose XInclude processing depends on the receipt of

<head>Included Items when processing XML</head>
<p>When processing XML, the
<termref def="dt-include-location">include location</termref> is

parsing the resource as if the media type were application/xml
(including character encoding determination).</p>
<note>
<p>The specifics of how an infoset is created are intentionally
unspecified, to allow for flexibility by implementations and to
avoid defining a particular processing model for components of

validation are performed, for example, are not constrained by
this specification.</p>
</note>
<note>
<p>The character encodings of the including and included

</note>
<p>Resources that are unavailable for any reason (for example the
resource doesn't exist, connection difficulties or security

a fetchable one, the resource is in an unsupported encoding, or the

not to be XML)

Resources that contain non-well-formed XML result in a
<termref def="dt-error">fatal error</termref>.</p>
<note>
<p>The distinction between a resource error and a fatal error
is somewhat implementation-dependent.  Consider an include
location returning an HTML document, perhaps as an error page.
One processor might determine that no infoset can be created
from the resource (by examining the media type, for example)
and raise a resource error, enabling fallback behavior.
Another processor with no such heuristics might attempt to
parse the non-XML resource as XML and encounter a
well-formedness (fatal) error.</p>

<p>Some applications will want to attempt to resolve these sorts of

between the <emph role="infoset-property">references</emph>
property and the <emph role="infoset-property">attribute type</emph>
property, which might arise in the following circumstances:</p>
<ulist>
<item>
<p>A document fragment contains an IDREF pointing to an element
in the included document but outside the part being included.
In this case there is no element in the result infoset that
corresponds to the element value in the original

</item>
<item>
<p>A document or document fragment is not self-contained.
That is, it contains IDREFs which do not refer to an element within
that document or document fragment, with the intention that these
references will be realized after inclusion.  In this case,
the value of the <emph role="infoset-property">references</emph>
property is unknown or has no value.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The result infoset has ID clashes - that is, more than one

ID with the same <emph role="infoset-property">normalized value</emph>.
In this case, attributes with <emph role="infoset-property">attribute

<emph role="info-item">attribute information item</emph>
whose <emph role="infoset-property">attribute type</emph> property

<head>Properties Preserved by the Infoset</head>
<p>As an infoset transformation, XInclude operates on the logical

other than those specifically modified by this specification are
preserved during inclusion.  The <emph role="infoset-property">include history</emph>
and <emph role="infoset-property">language</emph>
properties introduced in this specification is also preserved.
Extension properties such as
<bibref ref="XMLSchemas"/> Post Schema Validation Infoset (PSVI)

preserve these properties in the resulting infoset if they

<p>For instance, the PSVI <emph role="infoset-property">validity</emph>
property describes the conditions of ancestors and descendants.
Modification of ancestors and descendants during the XInclude
process can render the value of this property inaccurate.  By
default, XInclude strips this property, but by user option the

<p>The infoset resulting from resolving inclusions on this document
is the same (except for the <emph role="infoset-property">include history</emph>
and <emph role="infoset-property">language</emph> properties)
as that of the following document:</p>
<eg><![CDATA[<document xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
          xmlns:eg="http://example.org/namespace/example">
<p>This example shows attribute replacement.</p>

<note eg:root="one" xml:id="inc1"><p>Consider the <phrase xml:id="wombat">Wombat</phrase>.</p></note>

<note eg:root="two" xml:id="inc2"><p>Consider the <phrase xml:id="wombat">Wombat</phrase>.</p></note>

</document>
]]></eg>

<p>Observe that the <code>xml:id</code> attribute on the
included <code>note</code> element has been replaced by
<phrase diff="del">the copied attribute</phrase>
<phrase diff="add">the <att>set-xml-id</att> value</phrase>
from the <code>xi:include</code> element.
<phrase diff="del">This copying</phrase>
<phrase diff="add">The <att>set-xml-id</att> attribute</phrase>
has
no effect on descendants. Subsequent fixup will still be required in
order to make this document valid. Additional fixup would also be
required if the resulting document contained any IDREF pointers to the now
missing “<code>note</code>” ID.</p>
